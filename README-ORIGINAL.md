Prudence
========

Prudence is a platform on which you can build scalable web frontends and
network services. Server-side code can be written in JavaScript, Python, Ruby,
PHP, Lua, Groovy, or Clojure. Though minimalistic, Prudence addresses
real-world, practical needs, from state-of-the-art server- and client-side
caching to URI rewriting and virtual hosting.

Please see the [Prudence web site](http://threecrickets.com/prudence/) for
comprehensive documentation.

Building Prudence
-----------------

To *completely* build Prudence you need [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/), [Maven]
(http://maven.apache.org/) and [Sincerity](http://threecrickets.com/sincerity/).

You may need to create a file named "/build/private.properties" (see below) and
override the default locations for Maven and Sincerity.

Then, simply change to the "/build/" directory and run "ant".

During the build process, build and distribution dependencies will be
downloaded from an online repository at http://repository.threecrickets.com/, so
you will need Internet access.

The result of the build will go into the "/build/distribution/" directory.
Temporary files used during the build process will go into "/build/cache/",
which you are free to delete.

If you *only* want to build the Prudence Jar, then you only need Ant (you don't
need Maven and Sincerity). Run the "libraries" Ant target instead of the default
one.


Configuring the Build
---------------------

The "/build/custom.properties" file contains configurable settings, along with
some commentary on what they are used for. You are free to edit that file,
however to avoid git conflicts, it would be better to create your own
"/build/private.properties" instead, in which you can override any of the
settings. That file will be ignored by git.

To avoid the "bootstrap class path not set" warning during compilation
(harmless), configure the "compile.boot" setting in "private.properties" to the
location of an "rt.jar" file belonging to JVM version 6.


Building the Prudence Manual
----------------------------

To build the manual, as part of the standard build process, you will need to
install [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/) and [eLyXer](http://elyxer.nongnu.org/), and
configure their paths in "private.properties".


Packaging
---------

You can create distribution packages (zip, deb, rpm, IzPack) using the
appropriate "package-" Ant targets. They will go into the "/build/distribution/"
directory.

If you wish to sign the deb and rpm packages, you need to install the
"dpkg-sig" and "rpm" tools, and configure their paths and your keys in
"private.properties".

In order to build the platform installers (for Windows and OS X), you will need
to install [InstallBuilder](http://installbuilder.bitrock.com/) and configure
its path in "private.properties".

BitRock has generously provided the Prudence project with a free license,
available under "/build/installbuilder/license.xml". It will automatically be
used by the build process.
